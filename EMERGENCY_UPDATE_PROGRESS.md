# 🚨 Emergency Database Update - Progress Tracker

## ✅ PHASE 1: COMPLETE (15 services)
- ❌ Removed Gabtoli fire station duplicate
- ✅ Added 15 new Dhaka city hospitals with Bengali names

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Continuing full implementation

Due to the massive scope (180+ services), I'm implementing this in manageable batches while maintaining code quality.

**Strategy:**
- Using multi_replace_file_content for targeted additions
- Ensuring proper TypeScript formatting
- Adding Bengali names for all entries
- Maintaining accurate coordinates

**Next Batches:**
1. ✅ Phase 1: 15 hospitals (DONE)
2. 🔄 Phase 2: Remaining Dhaka hospitals + Greater Dhaka hospitals
3. 🔄 Phase 3: All police stations (GMP + districts)
4. 🔄 Phase 4: All fire stations (Greater Dhaka Division)

**Estimated completion:** Continuing implementation systematically to ensure quality...
