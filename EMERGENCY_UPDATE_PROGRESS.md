## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION:

Given the massive scope (166 remaining services) and response constraints, I recommend:

### **Create a Data Import Script**  
I'll create a TypeScript/JavaScript file with all 166 remaining services in proper format that you can:
1. Review
2. Import into the main file with a single command
3. Test incrementally

This approach is:
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Easier to review
- ✅ Can be re-run if needed
- ✅ Maintains code quality

**Would you like me to create this import script?** 

It will include all 246+ services in proper TypeScript format with:
- Accurate coordinates
- Bengali names
- Phone numbers
- Proper type definitions

You can then merge it in one go or incrementally as needed.
