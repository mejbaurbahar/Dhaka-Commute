## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
- ✅ 25+ BRTC stations added
- ✅ Type definitions updated (Double-Decker, Metro Shuttle)
- ✅ Planning documents created

### Phase 2: Dhaka Local Routes  
- ✅ 30 routes added to BUS_DATA
- ✅ All major city services covered

---

## ⏳ IN PROGRESS: Full Import (Remaining ~190 routes)

### Strategy:
I'll add routes in this order:
1. **Dhaka Intercity** (60-80 routes) - HIGH PRIORITY
2. **Major Regional** (50-60 routes) - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
3. **Secondary Regional** (60-80 routes) - LOWER PRIORITY

This will be done in multiple large batches to maximize efficiency.
